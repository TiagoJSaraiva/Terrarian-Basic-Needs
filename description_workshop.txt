Survival in Terraria reaches a new level of realism!

This mod transforms your journey into a constant struggle against your own needs. Beyond fighting monsters, you must now battle Hunger and Sleep, which directly affect your performance in combat and exploration.

Face the extremes of nature with a Temperature system that can leave you freezing or overheated. And keep your Sanity intact, as stress and the fear of the unknown can have unpredictable consequences on your mind.

Prepare for an adventure where your greatest battle is against your own body and the dangers of nature.
